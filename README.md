Smart Camera Simulation Environment

CamSim is a simple 2D simulation environment for smart-camera networks. Smart-cameras are implemented as self-interested agents able to work collectively towards specific goals. Our simulation environment allows you to concentrate on your algorithms for self-adaptation and self-organisation of the cameras within the network instead of spending time and money on setting up a real camera network. Furthermore, relaxing various problems of computer vision and network communication allows to focus on algorithms that really matter to you.

#Tutorials

You can find a tutorial on how to run CamSim for you experiments [HERE](https://github.com/EPiCS/CamSim/wiki/Experiments).

An introductory tutorial on how to implement your own communication policy can be found [HERE] (https://github.com/EPiCS/CamSim/wiki/Creating-a-Communication-Policy).
